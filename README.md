# Pet Rock C++ Text Game
This is a simple C++-based text game where the user has a pet rock of a chosen name and a starting numerical health value of 18. This pet rock then encounters a series of "enemy characters". Each encounter is a duel between the two characters; different enemies have different corresponding starting health values. With each round, the enemy "attacks" the rock (i.e., inflicts a pseudorandom amount of damage - reduction to the health value), and the user decides whether the pet rock should attack as well or restock their health without firing at the enemy. The object of the game is for the pet rock to win as many duels as possible.

## Run
Simply run `make` to generate the petRock binary which can then be run.
